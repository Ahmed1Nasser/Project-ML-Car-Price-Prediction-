# introduction
There are a lot of car manufacturers in the US. With the development of manufacturing units and tests, there are a lot of cars being manufactured with a lot of features. Therefore, innovators are coming up with the latest developments in the field and they are ensuring that the drivers get the best experience going on a ride in these cars.
# Business Constraints / Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)
However, one of the challenging aspects of running the sales for cars is to accurately give the best price for cars which ensures that a lot of people buy them and there is a great demand because of this price. Factors that influence the price of cars are mileage, car size, manufacturer, and many others as well. But for humans to comprehensively decide the price is difficult especially when there are a lot of these features that influence the price. One of the solutions to this challenge is to use machine learning and data science to understand insights and make valuable predictions that generate profits for the companies.
# Machine Learning
**Machine Learning** have gained rapid traction in the recent decade.
It would be really helpful if we can predict the prices of a car based on a few sets of features such as horsepower, make and other features.
Imagine if a company wants to set the price of a car based on some of the features such as make, horsepower, and mileage.
It could do so with the help of machine learning models that would help it to determine the price of a car.
This would ensure that the company sets the right amount so that they get the most profits while setting such a price.
Therefore, the machine learning models that we would be working with would ensure that the right price is set for new cars which would save a lot of money for car manufacturers respectively.
We would be working with the car prices prediction data and looking for the predictions of different kinds of cars.
We would be first visualizing the data and understanding some of the information that is very important for predictions.
We would be using different regression techniques to get the average price of the car under consideration.
